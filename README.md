## What is Focus Flow?

A React application that helps photographers to maintain a list of upcoming photo sessions and also allow photographers to save online photo ideas to the flow board.

My friends and I have done photography on the side and there was never an app that fulfilled our needs. In the past, I used a calendar app to keep track of information and Pinterest to save ideas that would be great for photo sessions. I developed Focus Flow to combine both features and to streamline the process for photographers.

## Features

* User can log in or register to create a new account
* User can add, delete or edit photo sessions
* User can add, delete or edit photo ideas
* User can add url address to upload photo on Flow Board
* User can search for a specific photo session by month, client's name, event type or location
* Photo sessions are sorted by dates in chronological order
* User can search on Flow Board by any word in comments to find a specific idea
